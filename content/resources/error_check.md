description: Supporting file for an assignment to modify a PAM demodulator to be an
  optimum MAP detector for antipodal signaling, test the demodulator in the presence
  of noise, and compare the results to the theoretical error probability. Takes in
  bitstring B1 and B2, return number of bit errors and error rate.
